# Unhandled Error in Async Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js Express.js applications: improper error handling within asynchronous route handlers.

The `bug.js` file showcases an Express.js route that performs an asynchronous operation.  If the asynchronous operation fails, the error is logged to the console, but no error response is sent to the client. This can lead to unexpected behavior and a poor user experience.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.  It demonstrates how to properly catch and handle errors, ensuring that appropriate error responses are sent to the client even when asynchronous operations fail.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies (Express.js).
4. Run `node bug.js` to start the server with the bug.
5. Make a request to `http://localhost:3000`. The server will fail silently.
6. Run `node bugSolution.js` to start the server with the fix.
7. Make a request to `http://localhost:3000`.  The server will now return a proper error response.
